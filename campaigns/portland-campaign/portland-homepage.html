                    <h3>Session 4 | DM David Kelley</h3>
                    <p>Today we find our party, <a
                            href="/DND-Wiki/campaigns/portland-campaign/pcs/arlo-hardrock.html">Arlo</a>, <a
                            href="/DND-Wiki/campaigns/portland-campaign/pcs/mahron-diate.html">Mahron</a>, and
                        Lumberjack returning
                        with <a href="/DND-Wiki/campaigns/portland-campaign/pcs/andi-highwynd.html">Andi&apos;s</a>
                        corpse to town. When they arrive, Arlo decides to go recover
                        from this ordeal in his mountain home. Soon after the party&apos;s arrival <a
                            href="/DND-Wiki/campaigns/portland-campaign/pcs/lionore.html">Lionore&apos;s</a> voyage
                        ends and makes port. With Lionore learning of Andi&apos;s death and Mahron of the blight
                        no longer targeting the church, they head to the town in the mouth of <a
                            href="/DND-Wiki/campaigns/portland-campaign/locations/portland/portland.html">Portland&apos;s</a>
                        valley, <a
                            href="/DND-Wiki/campaigns/portland-campaign/locations/vancouver/vancouver.html">Vancouver</a>.
                        On the road they encountered a gypsy camp and as they passed through, acquired a tag
                        along by the name of <a href="/DND-Wiki/campaigns/portland-campaign/pcs/asriel.html">Asriel</a>.
                        While in Vancouver, the party has learned from resident priest ,James Clover, of the recently
                        destroyed local
                        church, that an enemy with the title <a
                            href="/DND-Wiki/campaigns/portland-campaign/npcs/the-smiling-man.html">The Smiling Man</a>
                        has been destroying churches in the region. Due to the church and its people being destroyed,
                        resurrecting Andi seemed to be a lost cause. While on the road returning to Portland, the uncle
                        of
                        Asriel appeared and handily retrieves his wayward nephew while resurrecting Andi. The far
                        reaching effects of this resurrection have yet to be seen.
